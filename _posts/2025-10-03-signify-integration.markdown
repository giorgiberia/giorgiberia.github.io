I recently wrapped up a deep dive into **Signify**'s document workflow platform and integrated it into my delivery toolkit. Signify impressed me with its balance of compliant e-signatures and flexible document generation, so I wanted to share why it caught my attention.

### Why Signify stood out
- **Unified document creation & signatures:** Signify lets us build branded templates, merge customer data, and collect signatures in a single flow. No more hopping between editors, PDF tools, and signature portals.
- **Granular compliance & security:** Built-in audit trails, EU & US data residency options, and granular role-based permissions mean we can confidently support regulated industries without spinning up custom controls from scratch.
- **Developer-first integration:** Their REST APIs, webhooks, and SDKs allowed me to wire Signify into existing CRM and ERP systems quickly. I was able to trigger document assembly from workflow events and keep stakeholders in sync with real-time status updates.

### What this means for my clients
If you’re scaling contract-heavy operations—think onboarding packs, vendor agreements, or regulated disclosures—Signify keeps teams fast and compliant. With this integration in place, I can now offer:
- Automated document generation that reflects the latest product or pricing changes.
- Guided signing experiences embedded directly in your customer portals.
- Live visibility into signature progress, plus proactive alerts when approvals stall.
