**Faster, more dependable website support — now with an actual chat instead of a form. 🚀**

I built a Telegram Support Bot that turns every “Contact us” tap into a live thread routed straight to a shared team group. Any teammate can jump in with an immediate reply, the whole conversation is captured end-to-end, and customers get answers sooner—without adding another platform to your stack. 📈

### How it runs (at a glance)
- **Client → Bot:** When a visitor pings the bot, the message appears in a dedicated support group with a tidy header (name, ID, message text).
- **Team → Client:** A staff member answers the forwarded message in the group; the bot echoes it back to the client and posts a delivery confirmation in the channel.
- **Logging:** Both directions land in a lightweight store for auditing and reporting.

### Behind the scenes (key details)
- **Runtime:** Python with `python-telegram-bot` and async handlers.
- **Data:** Slim SQLite tables track messages and delivery state, safely cross-referencing the group post with the client chat.
- **Routing:** Reply mapping ensures responses stay tied to the originating client message—no stray broadcasts.
- **Resilience:** Thoughtful rate-limit handling, idempotent update processing, and transparent error feedback in the support group.
- **Ops:** Works with polling or webhooks and emits structured logs (timestamps, user IDs) for observability and quick analytics.
- **Privacy & security:** Sensitive content stays private; tokens and IDs live in environment variables and never leak.

### Why it matters
- One inbox everyone can manage—inside Telegram.
- Faster first responses and clearer ownership, all without switching tools.
- Searchable history for QA, training, and product insights.
