I built Neighborhood Management System (NMS) to make everyday building life simpler for the people who live there. No more guessing where to report a problem or chasing updates—NMS puts your home, neighbors, and building info in one clear, friendly place.

🏠 What you can do

Report & track fixes — Log apartment or building issues in seconds, see real-time status, and mark what’s urgent so it gets attention first.

Stay private & secure — Role-aware, JWT-based sign-in means you only see the apartments and buildings you’re connected to.

Collaborate easily — Threaded comments and quick up/down votes help your community surface the most important topics and keep progress visible.

Know your neighbors — A simple directory shows active community members and the homes they represent, so coordinating repairs or shared tasks is smoother.

💬 Why neighbors like it

Transparent maintenance progress—no more black holes.

Faster, calmer decision-making without endless chats and phone calls.

A digital-first, resident-centered way to keep the building running well.

If you want a clearer, more connected building experience, I’d love to help bring NMS to your community. Comment or DM to get started.
