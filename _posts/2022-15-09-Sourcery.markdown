Somewhere a year ago I stumped upon the tool called Sourcery. 
It is a great tool for refactoring your code.
It can be used as a plugin for PyCharm, Vs Code.

look at the action below
![Sourcery gif](/img/blog/sourcery_example.gif)


{% highlight Python %}
# Before
def is_even(num):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# After
def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0

{% endhighlight %}

they have a lot of refactoring options, and you can even create your own refactoring rules.
they have 3 tiers
- Free
- Pro
- Team

even the free tier is great.

you can check it out here [Sourcery](https://sourcery.ai/)
