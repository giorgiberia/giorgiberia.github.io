I’ve always been drawn to building end-to-end systems 🌐, but mobile apps always felt like another universe 🚀 — until 
**React Native** made the transition almost seamless.

Getting started was easier than I imagined. With my React background, many concepts carried over directly ⚡ —
components, hooks, and state management all felt familiar. Adding **TypeScript** on top made the process even clearer
and more reliable ✅.

Now I can build solutions not only for the web 💻 but also for **iOS 📱 and Android 🤖**, all powered by the same backend
systems I’ve been developing with Django and REST APIs.

**Stack Highlights:** React Native · TypeScript · Expo · Django API · OAuth2
