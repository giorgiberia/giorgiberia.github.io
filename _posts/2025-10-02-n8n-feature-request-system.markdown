Keeping product feedback organized is harder than collecting it. Ideas pour in from chats, meetings, and quick emails, then quietly disappear before anyone can size them up. I wanted a clearer way to respect every suggestion without adding more manual triage.

### The Problem
Feature requests often arrive through scattered channels, which means:

- Ideas get lost in inboxes and threads.
- Customers don’t get confirmation that their request was heard.
- Teams waste time copying information into tracking tools.

I needed something structured, transparent, and automated.

### The Solution: an n8n-powered flow ⚙️
n8n became the backbone of a lightweight workflow that connects customer submissions, my internal data table, and team communication.

1. **Form submission** – Customers share their idea through a simple web form. Required fields (name, contact, feature description, priority 1–5) keep inputs consistent and reduce follow-up.
2. **Insert into the data table** – Every submission lands in a data table with customer, contact, request details, priority, and a default status of “requested.” Sorting and prioritizing later becomes trivial.
3. **Immediate confirmation** – n8n instantly replies with a friendly acknowledgement so customers know their idea is in the queue.
4. **Real-time team notification** – A Discord message drops into the feature-request channel with the core details:
   
   ```text
   📩 New Feature Request
   👤 Name: <Customer>
   📧 Contact: <Email/Phone>
   💡 Request: <Feature description>
   🔢 Priority: <1–5>
   📌 Status: Requested
   ⏰ Created At: <Timestamp>
   ```

### Why it matters
This simple loop solves three persistent problems:

- ✅ Feedback is never lost—everything lives in one source of truth.
- ✅ Customers feel heard with immediate, personal confirmations.
- ✅ Teams stay aligned because new requests are visible in real time without manual updates.

By turning unstructured conversations into actionable records, the feature backlog stays honest, customers stay in the loop, and my team can focus on delivering the highest-impact ideas.
