🚀 Excited to share MiniCrm!
Over the past few sprints I've been building MiniCrm, a lightweight customer-engagement platform that punches far above its weight. It blends a polished React + Vite + PrimeReact front end with a rock-solid Django backend so growing teams can launch multi-channel campaigns—without enterprise overhead.

Why I’m proud of this release
✅ Unified outreach — Craft SMS and email campaigns in the same workspace, import contacts from Excel, and personalize messages on the fly with reusable templates.
📊 Actionable analytics — Daily delivery trends, encoding breakdowns (GSM-7/Unicode), cost estimates, and template performance dashboards make it obvious where to double down.
✍️ AI-assisted productivity — Built-in “Ask AI” helpers jumpstart copywriting, while bulk-send workflows keep teams focused on strategy, not busywork.
🧾 Compliance-ready CRM — Consent tokens, detailed communication logs, and a data model keep operations audit-friendly.

What’s new & noteworthy
📝 Explicit consent collection — Capture and store permission for marketing emails/SMS (opt-in, double opt-in, and revocation), with time-stamped tokens and a full audit trail.
🚀 Serious throughput — Thanks to background processing and queuing, MiniCrm can process ~50,000 SMS per hour, so you can scale peak campaigns.
⚡ Fast & cost-effective SMS — Ships with a prebuilt integration to https://ubill.ge/ for quick setup and affordable delivery.

Built for modern teams
🛠️ Developer-friendly — React + Vite on the front, Django services on the back, with Dockerfiles for painless deployments.
🧭 Operations-ready — Clear roles/permissions, environment-based configs, and observability hooks so you can ship safely and iterate quickly.

If you’re scaling a customer success or growth team and tired of duct-taping point solutions, MiniCrm delivers clarity, automation, and control in one elegant package.
Curious to see it in action? I can share a walkthrough or help you try it with your campaigns.
