This is Giorgi.
I am a software engineer, currently working at [Orbi Group](https://orbi.dev/).
Using this blog to share my thoughts and ideas.
Been working with Python and Django for the last 3.5 years.
I am also using JavaScript. Interested in learning more about Rust and Python.
Best at Api design, and building integrations and synchronizations
I am also interested in DevOps, and building CI/CD pipelines.
Tried FastAPI, and Django Rest Framework, and I like them both.
