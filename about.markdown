# 👋 About Me

**I’m Giorgi — a Python Developer, DevOps Enthusiast & Mobile Engineer**  
Based in Batumi, Georgia 🇬🇪

---

Welcome to my corner of the web! I’m a software engineer passionate about building **scalable systems**, automating workflows, and delivering solutions that actually make an impact. My career sits at the intersection of **backend engineering, DevOps**, and **mobile development**.

### 🧠 What I Do

- 🐍 **Python Backend Development** – Django & Django REST Framework
- ☸️ **DevOps Practices** – Docker & Kubernetes for cloud-ready deployments
- 🔄 **Automation & APIs** – turning repetitive tasks into streamlined pipelines
- 📱 **Mobile Apps** – React Native & TypeScript, powered by the same backends I build
- 🛠️ **Problem-Solving Mindset** – designing systems that are clean, maintainable, and reliable

I bring a **mid-level developer’s expertise** combined with self-taught grit and constant curiosity. My mission? Build products that work like magic — but are engineered with discipline.

---

### 🧗‍♂️ My Journey

I started by writing simple Python scripts — which quickly evolved into **full-stack web apps**, **DevOps pipelines**, and **production-grade bots**. Over time, I shifted from just “coding features” to **thinking in systems**: architecture, infrastructure, automation, and now **cross-platform mobile apps**.

Technologies I’m actively working with:

- **Backend & Services**: Python, Django / DRF, Celery
- **Databases & Caching**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- **Servers & Infra**: Nginx, systemd, Ubuntu servers
- **Mobile & Frontend**: React Native, Expo, TypeScript, React.js
- **Other**: Telegram bots, Chrome extensions, microservices

### 🧩 Beyond Code

When I’m not solving technical puzzles, you’ll probably find me:

- 🏓 Playing **table tennis** (and winning more often than not)
- 🎱 Lining up the perfect shot in **billiards**
- 💡 Exploring new technologies “just because”
- ❤️ Spending quality time with my **amazing wife**

I believe in continuous growth — professionally and personally. Clean code, shared knowledge, and meaningful projects are what drive me.
