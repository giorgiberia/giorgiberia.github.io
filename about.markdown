# 👋 About Me

**This is Giorgi.**  
A Dedicated Python Developer & DevOps Enthusiast — proudly based in Batumi, Georgia 🇬🇪

---

Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm Giorgi — a Python software developer with a growing focus on **DevOps** and a deep
passion for building smart, scalable, and efficient systems.

### 🧠 What I Do

- 🐍 **Python Development** – with a strong focus on **backend** using Django
- ☸️ **DevOps Practices** – especially **Docker** & **Kubernetes** for smoother deployments
- 🔄 **Automation & APIs** – because life’s too short to do things manually
- 🛠️ **Problem-Solving** – because code is just puzzle-solving with coffee

I'm a **mid-level developer** with hands-on experience, self-taught grit, and an unshakable curiosity. My mission? Build
clean, maintainable systems that work like magic — but are built like clockwork.

---

### 🧗‍♂️ My Journey

I began my tech path out of sheer curiosity — what started as Python scripts soon became full-scale web apps, DevOps
pipelines, and even some production-grade bots. Over time, I moved from just writing code to **thinking in systems**,
diving deep into architecture, cloud, and infrastructure optimization.

Some technologies I’m actively working with:

- Django / DRF, Celery
- PostgreSQL,Mysql,Redis
- Docker, Kubernetes
- GitHub Actions, CI/CD
- Nginx, systemd, Ubuntu servers
- Telegram bots & Chrome extensions
- And a **daily obsession with writing better code**

### 🧩 A Bit More Human

When I’m not neck-deep in code or YAML configs, you’ll find me:

- 🏓 Beating friends in **table tennis**
- 🎱 Calculating angles in **billiards**
- 💡 Exploring new tech stacks just for fun
- ❤️ Spending time with my **brilliant wife**

I believe in continuous growth — both professionally and personally. I'm building a future I can be proud of — with
clean code, shared knowledge, and meaningful work.
